# Finance 

## Hey There

Financial literacy is necessary not just to help women better manage their household and personal finances, but also to provide them the power to pick and access the right financial services and products, as well as to create and run their own businesses. Women who work not only become financially independent but also have a significant impact on society at large and the country. Their money helps to support the family's budget. Positive effects are shown on the family's way of life, finances, children's education, and retirement assets.
Therefore, we have found a solution. FinEd is a resource for learning about finance.
As part of a group project, we developed a website on financial education where women can learn everything there is to know about money and live independently. Here, we want to get you comfortable talking about all things related to MONEY.
